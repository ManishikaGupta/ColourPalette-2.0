## üéØ Project Overview
This project implements a computer vision solution for skin undertone classification using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging transfer learning with MobileNetV2, we achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Key Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained MobileNetV2 for feature extraction
Data Augmentation: Comprehensive augmentation pipeline to prevent overfitting
Two-Stage Training: Initial training with frozen base model, followed by fine-tuning
Balanced Classification: Handles four distinct undertone classes effectively

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture & Performance
Base Model: MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)

Fine-Tuning: Custom classification head; final layers unfrozen with a low learning rate

Evaluation Dataset: 1,489 images

Accuracy: 87%
