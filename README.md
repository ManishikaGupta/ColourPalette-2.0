## 🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a computer vision solution for skin undertone classification using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging transfer learning with MobileNetV2, we achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Key Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained MobileNetV2 for feature extraction
Data Augmentation: Comprehensive augmentation pipeline to prevent overfitting
Two-Stage Training: Initial training with frozen base model, followed by fine-tuning
Balanced Classification: Handles four distinct undertone classes effectively

## 🏗️ Architecture
MobileNetV2 (Pre-trained, ImageNet weights)
    ->
GlobalAveragePooling2D
    ->
Dropout(0.5)
    ->
Dense(128, activation='relu')
    ->
Dense(4, activation='softmax')

## Training Strategy

Stage 1 - Feature Extraction: Train only the classifier head with frozen MobileNetV2 

Stage 2 - Fine-tuning: Unfreeze base model and train end-to-end with lower learning rate
